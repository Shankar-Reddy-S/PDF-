**PDF Parsing and Interviewing Assistant**

Welcome to the PDF Parsing and Interviewing Assistant project. This tool harnesses the power of a Large Language Model (LLM) to effectively parse PDF documents, comprehend their contents, and engage in interactive interviews with users based on the extracted information. Below is a comprehensive guide to help you understand and utilize this tool proficiently.

### Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Ensure that all required dependencies are installed to execute this project seamlessly. Essential libraries such as `pdfminer` for PDF parsing and `transformers` for leveraging the LLM should be installed.

2. **Setup**: Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory.

3. **Environment**: Consider establishing a virtual environment to manage dependencies efficiently. Tools like `virtualenv` or `conda` can be employed for this purpose.

4. **Dependencies**: Install necessary Python libraries using pip or any preferred package manager. Refer to the `requirements.txt` file for the complete list of dependencies.

### Usage

1. **Parsing PDFs**: Utilize the provided scripts to parse PDF documents. The LLM will meticulously analyze the content of the PDF and extract pertinent information.

2. **User Interaction**: Upon parsing the PDF, the assistant will initiate an interactive interview with the user, grounded in the acquired content. It will pose questions and evaluate the user's responses.

3. **Feedback Loop**: The assistant incorporates a feedback loop mechanism. If the user's response is incorrect, the assistant provides corrective feedback and adjusts its questioning strategy accordingly.

4. **Continuous Learning**: With each interaction, the assistant refines its understanding of the PDF content and the user's preferences. This iterative process facilitates more accurate interviews over time.

### Example

```python
from pdf_parser import parse_pdf
from interview_assistant import InterviewAssistant

# Parse PDF document
parsed_content = parse_pdf("example.pdf")

# Initialize Interview Assistant
assistant = InterviewAssistant(parsed_content)

# Begin Interview
assistant.start_interview()
```
